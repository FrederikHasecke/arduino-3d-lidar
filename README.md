# Arduino 3D Lidar

This repository includes the .stl files, the electronic components, wiring instructions, and the software needed to create your own cheap home-made three-dimensional rotating lidar sensor that provides a full 360Â° view of the environment at a frequency of 2 Hz detected.

The title of this project says that while this is an Arduino project, you can find a code version for an ESP32 as well. There are small but important differences here.
